///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
//
// Welcome to your first Cloud Script revision!
//
// Cloud Script runs in the PlayFab cloud and has full access to the PlayFab Game Server API 
// (https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Server), and it runs in the context of a securely
// authenticated player, so you can use it to implement logic for your game that is safe from
// client-side exploits. 
//
// Cloud Script functions can also make web requests to external HTTP
// endpoints, such as a database or private API for your title, which makes them a flexible
// way to integrate with your existing backend systems.
//
// There are several different options for calling Cloud Script functions:
//
// 1) Your game client calls them directly using the "ExecuteCloudScript" API,
// passing in the function name and arguments in the request and receiving the 
// function return result in the response.
// (https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Client/method/ExecuteCloudScript)
// 
// 2) You create PlayStream event actions that call them when a particular 
// event occurs, passing in the event and associated player profile data.
// (https://api.playfab.com/playstream/docs)
// 
// 3) For titles using the Photon Add-on (https://playfab.com/marketplace/photon/),
// Photon room events trigger webhooks which call corresponding Cloud Script functions.
// 
// The following examples demonstrate all three options.
//
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


// This is a Cloud Script function. "args" is set to the value of the "FunctionParameter" 
// parameter of the ExecuteCloudScript API.
// (https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Client/method/ExecuteCloudScript)
// "context" contains additional information when the Cloud Script function is called from a PlayStream action.
handlers.helloWorld = function (args, context) {
    
    // The pre-defined "currentPlayerId" variable is initialized to the PlayFab ID of the player logged-in on the game client. 
    // Cloud Script handles authenticating the player automatically.
    var message = "Hello " + currentPlayerId + "!";

    // You can use the "log" object to write out debugging statements. It has
    // three functions corresponding to logging level: debug, info, and error. These functions
    // take a message string and an optional object.
    log.info(message);
    log.debug("helloWorld:", { input: args.inputValue });

    // The value you return from a Cloud Script function is passed back 
    // to the game client in the ExecuteCloudScript API response, along with any log statements
    // and additional diagnostic information, such as any errors returned by API calls or external HTTP
    // requests. They are also included in the optional player_executed_cloudscript PlayStream event 
    // generated by the function execution.
    // (https://api.playfab.com/playstream/docs/PlayStreamEventModels/player/player_executed_cloudscript)
    return { messageValue: message };
}

// This is a simple example of making a PlayFab server API call
handlers.makeAPICall = function (args, context) {
    
    // The pre-defined "server" object has functions corresponding to each PlayFab server API 
    // (https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Server). It is automatically 
    // authenticated as your title and handles all communication with 
    // the PlayFab API, so you don't have to write extra code to issue HTTP requests. 
    var playerStatResult = server.UpdateUserStatistics (
        {
            PlayFabId: currentPlayerId,
            UserStatistics: {Level:2}
        }
    );
}

// This is a simple example of making a web request to an external HTTP API.
handlers.makeHTTPRequest = function (args, context) {
    var headers = {
        "X-MyCustomHeader": "Some Value"
    };
    
    var body = {
        input: args,
        userId: currentPlayerId,
        mode: "foobar"
    };

    var url = "http://httpbin.org/status/200";
    var content = JSON.stringify(body);
    var httpMethod = "post";
    var contentType = "application/json";

    // The pre-defined http object makes synchronous HTTP requests
    var response = http.request(url, httpMethod, content, contentType, headers, logRequestAndResponse);
    return { responseContent: response };
}

// This is a simple example of a function that is called from a
// PlayStream event action. (https://playfab.com/introducing-playstream/)
handlers.handlePlayStreamEventAndProfile = function (args, context) {
    
    // The event that triggered the action 
    // (https://api.playfab.com/playstream/docs/PlayStreamEventModels)

// Below are some examples of using Cloud Script in slightly more realistic scenarios

// This is a function that the game client would call whenever a player completes
// a level. It updates a setting in the player's data that only game server
// code can write - it is read-only on the client - and it updates a player
// statistic that can be used for leaderboards. 
//
// A funtion like this could be extended to perform validation on the 
// level completion data to detect cheating. It could also do things like 
// award the player items from the game catalog based on their performance.
handlers.completedLevel = function (args, context) {
    var level = args.levelName;
    var monstersKilled = args.monstersKilled;

        Data: {
            lastLevelCompleted: level
        }
    });

            level_monster_kills: monstersKilled
        }
    });

    log.debug("Updated level_monster_kills stat for player " + currentPlayerId + " to " + monstersKilled);
}


// In addition to the Cloud Script handlers, you can define your own functions and call them from your handlers. 
// This makes it possible to share code between multiple handlers and to improve code organization.
handlers.updatePlayerMove = function (args) {
    var validMove = processPlayerMove(args);
    return { validMove: validMove };
}


// This is a helper function that verifies that the player's move wasn't made
// too quickly following their previous move, according to the rules of the game.
// If the move is valid, then it updates the player's statistics and profile data.
// This function is called from the "UpdatePlayerMove" handler above and also is 
// triggered by the "RoomEventRaised" Photon room event in the Webhook handler
// below. 
//
// For this example, the script defines the cooldown period (playerMoveCooldownInSeconds)
// as 15 seconds. A recommended approach for values like this would be to create them in Title
// Data, so that they can be queries in the script with a call to GetTitleData
// (https://api.playfab.com/Documentation/Server/method/GetTitleData). This would allow you to
// make adjustments to these values over time, without having to edit, test, and roll out an
// updated script.

// Photon Webhooks Integration
//
// The following functions are examples of Photon Cloud Webhook handlers.

// in the Game Manager, your Photon applications are automatically configured
// to authenticate players using their PlayFab accounts and to fire events that 
// trigger your Cloud Script Webhook handlers, if defined. 
// This makes it easier than ever to incorporate multiplayer server logic into your game.
